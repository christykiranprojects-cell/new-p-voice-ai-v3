Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Voice-Based Medicine Order Recording System
________________________________________
1. Purpose
This SOP explains how to correctly record medicine orders using the voice-based STT system to ensure accurate transcription, correct quantity capture, and smooth processing.
This SOP is mandatory for all authorized users.
________________________________________
2. Authorized Users
This system is intended for use only by:
•	Doctors
•	Pharmacists
•	Medical store operators
•	Trained healthcare staff
•	Other authorized medicine-knowledgeable personnel
________________________________________
3. Audio Recording Environment
Before starting the recording:
•	Use a mobile phone or approved recording device
•	Record in a quiet environment as much as possible
•	Avoid background noise (TV, traffic, conversations)
•	Hold the device about 20–30 cm from your mouth
•	Speak clearly at a normal pace
________________________________________
4. Speech Guidelines
•	Speak clearly and calmly
•	Use full medicine names
•	Speak one medicine at a time
•	Pause briefly (1–2 seconds) between medicines
•	Do not mix casual conversation with medicine details
________________________________________
5. Mandatory Medicine Speaking Order (VERY IMPORTANT)
Always follow this fixed order while speaking:
1.	Medicine Name
2.	Strength / Dosage
3.	Medicine Type (Tablet, Capsule, Syrup, Injection, etc.)
4.	Quantity (spoken immediately after medicine type)
⚠️ The first number spoken after the medicine type is automatically treated as the quantity.
________________________________________
6. Strength and Unit Guidelines
•	You only need to speak the strength value
•	Do not worry about units such as:
o	milligram
o	gram
o	millilitre
✔️ The system automatically understands and normalizes units using backend aliases.
________________________________________
7. Correct Speaking Examples
✅ Correct
•	“Paracetamol five hundred tablet ten”
•	“Amoxicillin two fifty capsule twenty”
•	“Cough syrup ten bottle one”
________________________________________
8. Incorrect Speaking Examples
❌ Incorrect
•	“Paracetamol ten tablets” (wrong order)
•	“Amoxicillin capsule twenty” (missing strength)
•	“That fever tablet five”
•	“Give paracetamol five hundred”
These formats may lead to incorrect transcription or rejection.
________________________________________
9. Quantity Speaking Rules
•	Do not say the word quantity
•	Speak the number clearly
•	Use full numbers:
o	“ten” instead of “one zero”
o	“twenty five” instead of “two five”
•	Do not use vague terms like:
o	some
o	few
o	many
________________________________________
10. Recording Multiple Medicines
When recording more than one medicine:
•	Complete one medicine fully
•	Pause for 1–2 seconds
•	Then speak the next medicine
✅ Correct
“Paracetamol five hundred tablet ten …
Amoxicillin two fifty capsule twenty”
________________________________________
11. What NOT to Do During Recording
•	Do not correct yourself mid-sentence
•	Do not repeat the same medicine multiple times
•	Do not use filler words like:
o	“sorry”
o	“no wait”
o	“actually”
•	If a mistake happens, stop and re-record
________________________________________
12. After Recording
•	Submit the recording after completion
•	Review the generated output if preview is available
•	If any medicine or quantity is incorrect:
o	Re-record the order
o	Do not attempt verbal corrections in the same audio
________________________________________
13. Data Integrity and Audit Compliance
All recordings and outputs are:
•	Time-stamped
•	User-attributed
•	Stored as original records
•	Available for audit and review
Users are responsible for ensuring the spoken order is accurate and intentional.
________________________________________
14. User Responsibility
By using this system, the user confirms that:
•	The spoken medicine order is correct
•	The recording follows this SOP
•	The generated output will be reviewed before use
________________________________________
End of SOP
________________________________________
If you want, next I can:
•	Create a 1-page quick-use card (lamination-friendly)
•	Make a poster version for pharmacy walls
•	Convert this into a training checklist
•	Align it to regulatory SOP formatting (version, approval, revision history)
I mean users need not use milligram and they offen say MG / GM / G 
Ahh — crystal clear now 👍
So the rule is:
•	Users may say: mg / milligram / gram / gm / g
•	Users may also skip units
•	Backend alias logic normalizes everything
•	SOP should reassure users, not restrict them
Below is the final, user-correct SOP wording, clean and unambiguous.
